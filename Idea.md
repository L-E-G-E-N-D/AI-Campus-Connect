**3. Problem Statement**  
College communication is often scattered across multiple channels like WhatsApp groups, notice boards, and emails.

A mobile app that centralizes all campus communication—announcements, events, lost & found, and academic help—into a single platform.  
An **AI assistant** is integrated to answer FAQs, summarize announcements, recommend events/clubs based on interests, and assist with academic queries.
